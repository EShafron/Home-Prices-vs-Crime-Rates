<h2>
    Zillow Housing Data & API Crime Rates
</h2>

<p>
    In this first project, we investigated the relationship between reported crime rates & housing values.<br><br>
    Our idea was to identify zip codes & counties where crime was most weighing down property values.<br>
    Then, in a subsequent analysis (to be completed), we could identify which of these geographic regions was likely to experience a drop in crime.<br>
    These zip codes & counties would be prime choices for oppurtunistic real-estate investment.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
    In the absence of this data, we compared the average crime rate in counties to the crime rate in specific zip codes in that county.<br>
    The idea was this could stand in as zip codes where crime rates were poised to drop (& housing prices were poised to climb).<br>
    Based on a simple linear regression, we calculated how much more a median property would be worth if crime in the zip code returned to the county average. <br>
    Depending on whether we were looking at median $ per sqft, or median home value index, different crime variables were significant, and different zip codes were returned.<br><br>
    The results are displayed below: <br>
